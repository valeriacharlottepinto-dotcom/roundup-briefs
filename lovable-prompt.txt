LOVABLE PROMPT — Copy and paste this into Lovable to build your news frontend
================================================================================

Build a beautiful, modern news aggregator website called "Roundup Briefs" focused on
Women, Feminism, and LGBTQIA+ news. It should have a dark, elegant aesthetic with
pride rainbow accents.

DESIGN STYLE:
- Dark background (#0f0f1a), card backgrounds (#1a1a2e)
- A thin 6-colour rainbow stripe across the very top of the page
- Gradient hero title "Roundup Briefs" using pink → purple → teal gradient text
- Typography: Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body text
- Cards with a coloured accent bar at the top (teal gradient for LGBTQIA+ sources,
  pink gradient for Women/Feminist sources, blue for general news)
- Hover effects on cards (slight lift + pink glow border)

LAYOUT:
- Full-width header with site name and tagline "Your condensed source for Women, Feminism & LGBTQIA+ news"
- A filters bar below the header with three rows:
    Row 1: Topic chips (multi-select toggles) — wraps to two lines on mobile
    Row 2: Timeline chips (single-select)
    Row 3: Search bar + Country dropdown + Source dropdown + article count
- Stats row: Total Articles | LGBTQIA+ count | Women count
- Responsive card grid (3 columns desktop, 2 tablet, 1 mobile)

TOPIC FILTER (Row 1 — multi-select):
Clickable chip/pill buttons. Multiple can be active at once. 12 topics plus "All":
  "All" (default, deselects others when clicked)
  "🩺 Reproductive Rights"     colour: #E91E8C
  "💰 Gender Pay Gap"          colour: #FFA52C
  "🏳️‍🌈 LGBTQIA+"                colour: #7B2FBE
  "🌍 Immigration"             colour: #00BCD4
  "⚖️ Human Rights"            colour: #FF0018
  "🏥 Health"                  colour: #4CAF50
  "📜 Law & Policy"            colour: #9C27B0
  "🏛️ Politics"                colour: #3F51B5
  "🎭 Culture & Media"         colour: #FF9800
  "⚽ Sports"                  colour: #008018
  "🛡️ Violence & Safety"       colour: #F44336
  "💼 Workplace"               colour: #607D8B
When a topic chip is active, it gets a coloured border and text matching its colour.
When "All" is active, no topic filter is applied.
Selecting any topic deselects "All". Deselecting all topics re-activates "All".
Multiple topics = OR logic (show articles matching ANY selected topic).

TIMELINE FILTER (Row 2 — single-select):
Clickable chip/pill buttons. Only one active at a time. Options:
  "All" (default) | "Today" | "This week" | "Last week" | "Last month" | "Last year"
Active chip gets teal coloured border and text.
Pass the selected value as ?time=today|this_week|last_week|last_month|last_year|all

SEARCH + FILTERS (Row 3):
- Search bar with magnifying glass icon — filters by headline + summary text
  Pass as ?search=KEYWORD
- Country dropdown — populated from /api/countries
  Pass as ?country=UK
- Source dropdown — populated from /api/sources
  Pass as ?source=BBC+News
- Article count display on the right (e.g. "142 articles")

All filters work together — the frontend builds a single API URL with all active
filter parameters combined.

EACH NEWS CARD should show:
- Coloured top accent bar
- Source name badge (grey)
- Category badges (teal "LGBTQIA+" or pink "Women" based on tags field)
- Topic badges (purple, from topics field — e.g. "Reproductive Rights", "Immigration")
- Article headline (article title)
- Short summary (3 lines max, truncated)
- Date scraped + "Read →" button linking to the original article URL
